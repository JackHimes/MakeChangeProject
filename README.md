# Make Change Project

## Description
This program acts as a simple cash register. The program asks how much the total is, then collects
user input. The program asks how much money was tendered, and collects user input. The program then calculates how much change is due for the customer. If the amount tendered is not enough, the program notifies the user of this. If the customer has exact change, the program notifies the user. If change is due, the program calculates how much of each bill/coin is required in the highest denomination possible (Ex: change due: 7.85 ---> 1 x 5 dollar bill, 2 x dollar bill, 3 x quarters, 1 x dime). This concludes the program.
